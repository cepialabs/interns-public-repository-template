📘 Internship Assignment Submission Guidelines

All interns must strictly follow the folder and branching structure below when submitting assignments. This ensures timely evaluation, accurate skill-wise scoring, and better visibility throughout your internship tenure.

✅ Step 1: Create Your Branch

Create a new branch using your Internship ID.

Format:

INT-25-FS-2567


You will receive your Internship ID from the Ignite platform.

Example:

git checkout -b INT-25-FS-2567

📁 Step 2: Create Weekly Folders

Inside your branch, create folders for each week:

week-1/
week-2/
week-3/
...

📂 Step 3: Create Day-wise Assignment Folders

Inside each week folder, create directories for each assignment using this format:

day-1-assignment-1/
day-1-assignment-2/
day-2-assignment-1/
...


Example structure:

INT-25-FS-2567
└── week-1/
    ├── day-1-assignment-1/
    ├── day-1-assignment-2/
    └── day-2-assignment-1/

📤 Step 4: Submit Your Work

Place all your assignment files (code, docs, screenshots, etc.) inside the correct folder.

Then commit and push your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Week 1 Day 1 Assignment 1 submission"
git push origin INT-25-FS-2567

⭐ Why This Structure Matters

Following this structure ensures:

✅ Faster and fair evaluation

✅ Accurate mapping of your work to skills

✅ Better visibility of your progress

✅ Stronger internship profile

✅ Improved final evaluation score

⚠️ Non-structured submissions may not be evaluated.

🧑‍💻 Be Professional. Be Consistent. Build Like an Engineer.
